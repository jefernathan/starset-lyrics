        <h1>Annihilated Love</h1>
        <p>Looking back I don't know how</p>
        <p>I had missed it before</p>
        <p>You secured the armaments, walled off</p>
        <p>Ready for war</p>
        <br>
        <p>You let the bombs just float away</p>
        <p>One by one</p>
        <p>Surprise attack</p>
        <p>Why hesitate?</p>
        <p>Damage done</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's armageddon in your mind</p>
        <p>You took the first shot every time</p>
        <p>There were no prisoners or friends</p>
        <p>Now it's the end</p>
        <p>Strangers again</p>
        <br>
        <p>It was anarchy with your weaponry</p>
        <p>You killed off all that was</p>
        <p>Burning everything till there was nothing</p>
        <p>Brought death down from above</p>
        <p>Annihilated love</p>
        <p>Annihilated love</p>
        <br>
        <p>There would be no armistice</p>
        <p>Battle lines have been drawn</p>
        <p>You would give no haven</p>
        <p>Its scorched earth sound the alarms</p>
        <br>
        <p>You firebombed the memories</p>
        <p>One by one</p>
        <p>Becoming instant enemies</p>
        <p>Hit and run</p>
        <br>
        <p>We knew eye for eye would leave us both blind</p>
        <p>But I was deaf and dumb</p>
        <p>I surrender I</p>
        <p>Lift the white flag high</p>
        <p>But now you're out for blood</p>
        <p>Annihilated love</p>
        <p>Annihilated love</p>
        <br>
        <p>The tragedy</p>
        <p>Of the war we made</p>
        <p>Was that I just couldn't surrender you</p>
        <p>The casualty</p>
        <p>Was only ever me</p>
        <p>Still I run through the flames for you</p>
        <p>Evacuate</p>
        <p>I'm a target marked</p>
        <p>Bullseye on my broken heart</p>
        <p>I amputate</p>
        <p>I'm torn apart</p>
        <p>And you got what you wanted</p>
        <p>You got what you wanted to</p>
        <p>Is that what you wanted?</p>
        <br>
        <p>We knew eye for eye would leave us both blind</p>
        <p>But I was deaf and dumb</p>
        <p>Annihilated love</p>
        <p>Annihilated love</p>
        <p>Annihilated love</p>
        <p>Annihilated love</p>
