        <h1>Earthrise</h1>
        <p>I push my feet to the edge</p>
        <p>I look and I face my world</p>
        <p>This lonely scene, I take it in</p>
        <p>It's hard to say where all of it begins and I end</p>
        <p>And I waited for the sky to change but, oh, it never did</p>
        <p>And I almost dropped my head and lost my faith</p>
        <p>Then I saw you from a distance</p>
        <p>You were worlds away</p>
        <p>Oh but you had me from the vision</p>
        <p>I never looked away again</p>
        <br>
        <p>I still fall for you like suns do for skies</p>
        <p>Cerulean pouring in from your eyes</p>
        <p>Just a hollow moon that you colorize</p>
        <p>So powerful, I feel so small but so alive</p>
        <p>Like watching the earthrise</p>
        <br>
        <p>I walk these streets of loneliness</p>
        <p>A tranquil sea on all horizons</p>
        <p>This empty scene of might-have-beens</p>
        <p>I stare at starless skies that call to me and I still wish</p>
        <p>(I still wish, I still wish, I still wish)</p>
        <br>
        <p>I still fall for you like suns do for skies</p>
        <p>Cerulean pouring in from your eyes</p>
        <p>Just a hollow moon that you colorize</p>
        <p>So powerful, I feel so small but so alive</p>
        <p>Like watching the earthrise</p>
        <br>
        <p>They said that we both were too different</p>
        <p>That all of the shine would fade away</p>
        <p>But I wish that I'd never listened</p>
        <p>'Cause you pulled me through the gray</p>
        <br>
        <p>I still fall for you like suns do for skies</p>
        <p>Cerulean pouring in from your eyes</p>
        <p>Just a hollow moon that you colorize</p>
        <p>So powerful, I feel so small but so alive</p>
        <p>Like watching the earthrise</p>
