        <h1>Devolution</h1>
        <p>We've been burying the pages</p>
        <p>We've been trying to erase this</p>
        <p>Built a wall between the truth and us</p>
        <p>And it's not enough</p>
        <br>
        <p>We've burned through all the witches</p>
        <p>From the paupers to the righteous</p>
        <p>In a bubble that will never bust</p>
        <p>And it's not enough</p>
        <br>
        <p>Left blind in the darkness</p>
        <p>But that's fine 'cause you like it</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sheep becoming wolves and you eat from the paw</p>
        <p>So open up and say</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>Let's all spoon-feed on our own delusions</p>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>All I see is a fake revolution</p>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>The same old things with the same solutions</p>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>It's anarchy, it's de-evolution</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's de-evolution</p>
        <br>
        <p>There's no wood for the bridges</p>
        <p>When the land is too divided</p>
        <p>We've been fighting off the undertow</p>
        <p>Now we fall below</p>
        <br>
        <p>So open up and take your medicine and say</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>Let's all spoon-feed on our own delusions</p>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>All I see is a fake revolution</p>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>The same old things with the same solutions</p>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>It's anarchy, it's de-evolution</p>
        <br>
        <p>De-evolution</p>
        <br>
        <p>"One general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, is multiply. Therein, let the strongest live, and the weakest die. Eventually, a species can become complacent. At that point, a de-evolution can occur. A spiral downwards, signaling an end for that life form."</p>
        <br>
        <p>You still eat straight from the paw</p>
        <br>
        <p>You still eat straight from the paw</p>
        <br>
        <p>Convoluted lies</p>
        <p>It's the end that you prophesize</p>
        <p>And it's all pretend</p>
        <p>From a bargain Darwin and you're inside the plan</p>
        <p>While the Lord Of Flies is opening its maw</p>
        <p>And the wolves are taking out their claws</p>
        <br>
        <p>You still eat straight from the paw</p>
        <p>You still eat straight from the paw</p>
        <p>You still eat straight from the paw</p>
        <br>
        <p>So open up, open up, open up and say</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>Let's all spoon-feed on our own delusions</p>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>All I see is a fake revolution</p>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>The same old things with the same solutions</p>
        <p>Ah-a-a-a-ahh</p>
        <p>It's anarchy, it's de-evolution</p>
        <p>It's de-evolution</p>
