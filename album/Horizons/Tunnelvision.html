        <h1>Tunnelvision</h1>
        <p>Blind, you wouldn't see what's real if it hit your eyes</p>
        <p>Lies, and fantasies to deal 'cause you're dead inside</p>
        <br>
        <p>So go on, put up defenses</p>
        <p>Pretend there's no consequences</p>
        <p>But it's just a dog and pony show</p>
        <p>Why feel it when you can hide it</p>
        <p>Don't look at it just deny it</p>
        <p>But I hate to say I told you so</p>
        <br>
        <p>Can you feel the heat come from the gun?</p>
        <p>Sending out the truth bombs, ten kiloton</p>
        <p>Marching to the beat of oblivion</p>
        <p>Hiding behind the web you have spun</p>
        <p>Tunnel vision</p>
        <p>Tunnel vision</p>
        <p>Tunnel vision</p>
        <p>Tunnel vision</p>
        <br>
        <p>Gaslight gaslight flames</p>
        <p>Hide the fire of a straw man burning</p>
        <p>Close-mind one-side games</p>
        <p>From a liar who won't stop subverting</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now you're narrowing your logic</p>
        <p>It's blurry and kind of toxic</p>
        <p>But you're full of braggadocio</p>
        <p>This was something you incited</p>
        <p>You opened up and invited</p>
        <p>And I hate to say I told you so</p>
        <br>
        <p>Can you feel the heat come from the gun?</p>
        <p>Sending out the truth bombs, ten kiloton</p>
        <p>Marching to the beat of oblivion</p>
        <p>Hiding behind the web you have spun</p>
        <p>Tunnel vision</p>
        <p>Tunnel vision</p>
        <p>Tunnel vision</p>
        <p>Tunnel vision</p>
        <br>
        <p>You took me for a fly</p>
        <p>And fancied yourself a spider in a web of little lies</p>
        <p>What a nice surprise</p>
        <p>When the curtain's pulled back you can see the whole trap inside</p>
        <p>And now the emperor has got no clothes</p>
        <p>What a lovely show</p>
        <p>When your cover's blown you'll never know</p>
        <p>'Cause you can't see past your nose</p>
        <br>
        <p>Can you feel the heat come from the gun?</p>
        <p>Sending out the truth bombs, ten kiloton</p>
        <p>Marching to the beat of oblivion</p>
        <p>Hiding behind the web you have spun</p>
        <p>Tunnel vision</p>
        <p>Tunnel vision</p>
