        <h1>Icarus</h1>
        <p>Fell out of the air and you broke your wings</p>
        <p>Like you're doing every other time</p>
        <p>Made a new pair out of broken things</p>
        <p>To give it all another try</p>
        <p>And you climb right up</p>
        <p>To the highest peaks</p>
        <p>And reach out to the edge of the world you seek</p>
        <p>Afraid of heights</p>
        <p>So you don't believe</p>
        <p>You could ever be good enough</p>
        <br>
        <p>Go on then, Icarus</p>
        <p>Take your turn</p>
        <p>You always fly right up</p>
        <p>Until it burns</p>
        <p>Your wings</p>
        <p>You never could change</p>
        <p>Always the victim</p>
        <p>Into the flames again</p>
        <p>Go on then, Icarus</p>
        <p>Take your turn</p>
        <p>You'll never go through them</p>
        <br>
        <p>Head in the clouds buried</p>
        <p>Your feet in the ground telling</p>
        <p>Yourself it's the world that holds you down</p>
        <p>But you've got your</p>
        <p>Chin held high</p>
        <p>And your chest pumped up</p>
        <p>The replica of a runner-up</p>
        <p>You were made for skies</p>
        <p>But you called your bluff</p>
        <p>Now you'll never be good enough</p>
        <br>
        <p>Go on then, Icarus</p>
        <p>Take your turn</p>
        <p>You always fly right up</p>
        <p>Until it burns</p>
        <p>Your wings</p>
        <p>You never could change</p>
        <p>Always the victim</p>
        <p>Into the flames again</p>
        <p>Go on then, Icarus</p>
        <p>Take your turn</p>
        <p>You'll never go through them</p>
        <br>
        <p>You'll never go through them</p>
        <p>You'll never go through them</p>
        <br>
        <p>So fall back down, back down again</p>
        <p>Got your head in the clouds on the ground again</p>
        <p>Looking for a scapegoat to hold your feet</p>
        <p>Pounding on your chest so you don't feel weak</p>
        <p>You fall back down, back down again</p>
        <br>
        <p>Go on then, Icarus</p>
        <p>Take your turn</p>
        <p>You always fly right up</p>
        <p>Until it burns</p>
        <p>Your wings</p>
        <p>You never could change</p>
        <p>Always the victim</p>
        <p>Into the flames again</p>
        <p>Go on then, Icarus</p>
        <p>Take your turn</p>
        <p>You'll never go through them</p>
