        <h1>Disappear</h1>
        <p>So how long, were you numb?</p>
        <p>'Cause it was cold as ice</p>
        <p>And I keep saying that I'm okay with it</p>
        <p>But that's another lie</p>
        <p>The truth is I've been dying slowly</p>
        <p>But no, not you, you just turned to drift into the night</p>
        <p>A parting scene of apathy</p>
        <p>In an instant shift to a stone heart paired with empty eyes</p>
        <p>That stared right through mine</p>
        <br>
        <p>I did the math but it just don't add up</p>
        <p>There's a whole world that used to be us</p>
        <p>Now there's an echo calling me</p>
        <p>Just a shred of memory</p>
        <br>
        <p>Emptiness but there's still a shadow</p>
        <p>I catch a glimpse of someone I should know</p>
        <p>Hard to tell if you were ever here</p>
        <p>I disappear, disappear</p>
        <p>I disappear, disappear</p>
        <br>
        <p>All is lost, slipped away</p>
        <p>Gone without a trace</p>
        <p>I sometimes wonder if it was real because</p>
        <p>All that's left seems fake like I'm trapped within a wrong dimension</p>
        <p>I tried so hard just to make you feel my pain</p>
        <p>If you had empathy you'd see I'd changed</p>
        <p>But like a ghost in your presence I dissipate</p>
        <p>I tried it all, it's all in vain</p>
        <br>
        <p>I did the math but it just don't add up</p>
        <p>There's a whole world that used to be us</p>
        <p>Now there's an echo calling me</p>
        <p>Just a shred of memory</p>
        <p>Emptiness but there's still a shadow</p>
        <p>I catch a glimpse of someone I should know</p>
        <p>Hard to tell if you were ever here</p>
        <p>I disappear, disappear</p>
        <p>I disappear, disappear</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sometimes I still slip and start to question if it was only in my mind</p>
        <p>It's hard to come to grips that you still exist when it feels just like you died</p>
        <p>So come one and all step right up and I'll perform a trick before your eyes</p>
        <p>I'll evaporate, gone without a trace, off the radar out of sight</p>
        <br>
        <p>I did the math but it just don't add up</p>

        <p>I catch a glimpse of someone I should know</p>
        <p>Hard to tell if you were ever here</p>
        <p>I disappear, disappear</p>
        <p>I disappear, disappear</p>
