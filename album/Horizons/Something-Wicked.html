        <h1>Something Wicked</h1>
        <p>Loving</p>
        <p>Hating</p>
        <p>Hoping</p>
        <p>Taking</p>
        <br>
        <p>I've been digging through the dirt that was left behind</p>
        <p>I've been dredging through the mud for it</p>
        <p>There's nothing that's alive or dead inside</p>
        <p>In you or in this</p>
        <br>
        <p>The crucifix in my hand's a lie</p>
        <p>'Cause nothing ever kills you</p>
        <p>I watered down the pain till the well went dry</p>
        <p>So pray for rain</p>
        <br>
        <p>And it gnawed</p>
        <p>Rose to the top again</p>
        <p>Back like a long-lost friend</p>
        <p>A wretch that I can't defend</p>
        <p>Oh my God</p>
        <p>Is this where the dreamer ends?</p>
        <p>Dark where the light had been</p>
        <p>Lost at the war within</p>
        <br>
        <p>And it clawed</p>
        <p>Back in the world again</p>
        <p>Here for a new revenge</p>
        <p>An enemy I can't condemn</p>
        <p>Oh my God</p>
        <p>Is this where the liar ends?</p>
        <p>Dark where the light had been</p>
        <p>Lost at the war within</p>
        <br>
        <p>Out of myself, I can feel it crawling</p>
        <p>How can I tell if this is the ending?</p>
        <p>Out of myself, it began evolving</p>
        <p>I am not well, repent I'm guilty</p>
        <p>How can I tell if the sky is falling?</p>
        <p>How can I fix what there is no mending?</p>
        <p>How can I tell if I am not well?</p>
        <p>I've lost myself</p>
        <p>I have come undone</p>
        <br>
        <p>And all of the horses</p>
        <p>And all of the men</p>
        <p>Won't put it back in place</p>
        <p>Or bury it where it had been</p>
        <p>When all of the forces</p>
        <p>Have been overrun</p>
        <p>You'll whisper, serpent tongue</p>
        <p>What you fear you have become</p>
        <br>
        <p>Something wicked this way comes</p>
        <p>Something wicked this way comes</p>
