        <h1>Infected </h1>
        <p>I think we did it this time</p>
        <p>There's something in the air inside the star shine</p>
        <p>There's something in the air we'll never know</p>
        <p>I can feel it take hold</p>
        <p>Infected</p>
        <br>
        <p>They're calling on the landlines</p>
        <p>The senators are standing on the shorelines</p>
        <p>The warning lights are burning all aglow</p>
        <p>Now we reap what we sow</p>
        <p>Infected</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do it one by one</p>
        <p>Put your hands up and run</p>
        <p>We're addicted to the panic</p>
        <p>And we hate the way this world has become</p>
        <p>But there ain't no cure for it</p>
        <p>We've been infected, infected</p>
        <p>Infected, infected</p>
        <p>Infected, infected</p>
        <p>Infected, infected</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here's a challenge for all mankind</p>
        <p>The preacher man is warning of the end times</p>
        <p>The weatherman agrees but he don't know</p>
        <p>So he's got to go now</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do it one by one</p>
        <p>Put your hands up and run</p>
        <p>We're addicted to the panic</p>
        <p>And we hate the way this world has become</p>
        <p>But there ain't no cure for it</p>
        <p>We've been infected, infected</p>
        <p>Infected, infected</p>
        <p>Infected, infected</p>
        <p>Infected, infected</p>
        <br>
        <p>One if by land and two if by sea</p>
        <p>Maybe it's both and we'll all get lucky</p>
        <p>Go to the end, man. Don't quit on me</p>
        <p>Get what you wanted</p>
        <p>Anarchy</p>
        <br>
        <p>One by one</p>
        <p>Put your hands up and run</p>
        <p>We're addicted to the panic</p>
        <p>And we hate the way this world has become</p>
        <p>But there ain't no cure for it</p>
        <p>We've been infected, infected</p>
        <p>Infected, infected</p>
        <p>Infected, infected</p>
        <p>Infected, infected</p>
