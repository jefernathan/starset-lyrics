        <h1>Bringing It Down</h1>
        <p>I saw it in your eyes</p>
        <p>I saw the creature deep inside</p>
        <p>You opened up your cage</p>
        <p>Pathetic insect</p>
        <p>Drawn to flame</p>
        <p>I'm falling apart</p>
        <p>Inside your holographic heart</p>
        <p>Lost souls dancing</p>
        <p>And now the lie's collapsing</p>
        <br>
        <p>There's something inside you that isn't right</p>
        <p>There's something that haunts your dreams at night</p>
        <p>There's something that you have lost</p>
        <p>And you're bringing it down</p>
        <p>You're bringing it down</p>
        <p>On top of us</p>
        <br>
        <p>I see the crimson thief</p>
        <p>Hanging on heartstrings</p>
        <p>Dripping bleach</p>
        <p>Victim with hands in sleeves</p>
        <p>Your lying swan sings</p>
        <p>As I reach</p>
        <p>I'm falling apart</p>
        <p>Inside your holographic heart</p>
        <p>Lost souls dancing</p>
        <p>And now the lie's collapsing</p>
        <br>
        <p>There's something inside you that isn't right</p>
        <p>There's something that haunts your dreams at night</p>
        <p>There's something that you have lost</p>
        <p>And you're bringing it down</p>
        <p>You're bringing it down</p>
        <p>On top of us</p>
        <br>
        <p>Silly me</p>
        <p>I thought I had it</p>
        <p>I came so close this time</p>
        <p>I knew your heart was plastic</p>
        <p>I still thought I could make it mine</p>
        <p>Surrender you my mind</p>
        <p>Your creature is inside...</p>
        <p>Devouring me alive</p>
        <br>
        <p>There's something inside you that isn't right</p>
        <p>There's something that haunts your dreams</p>
        <p>There's something that you have lost</p>
        <p>And you're bringing it down</p>
        <p>You're bringing it down</p>
        <p>On top of us</p>
