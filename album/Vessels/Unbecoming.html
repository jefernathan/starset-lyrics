        <h1>Unbecoming</h1>
        <p>I lost myself into the night</p>
        <p>And I flew higher</p>
        <p>Than I had ever</p>
        <p>But I still felt small</p>
        <p>I clipped my wings and fell from flight</p>
        <p>To open water</p>
        <p>And floated farther</p>
        <p>Away from myself</p>
        <br>
        <p>And I swam in the wakes of imposters</p>
        <p>Just to feel what it's like to pretend</p>
        <p>There's no dreams in the waves, only monsters</p>
        <p>And the monsters are my only friends</p>
        <br>
        <p>They're all that I was</p>
        <p>And never could be</p>
        <br>
        <p>Eyes in the dead still water</p>
        <p>Tried but it pushed back harder</p>
        <p>Cauterized and atrophied</p>
        <p>This is my unbecoming</p>
        <p>Knives in the backs of martyrs</p>
        <p>Lives in the burning fodder</p>
        <p>Cauterized and atrophied</p>
        <p>This is my unbecoming</p>
        <br>
        <p>You found me drifted out to sea</p>
        <p>It's automatic</p>
        <p>It's telepathic</p>
        <p>You always knew me</p>
        <p>And you laugh as I search for a harbor</p>
        <p>As you point where the halo had been</p>
        <p>But the light in your eyes has been squandered</p>
        <p>There's no angel in you in the end</p>
        <br>
        <p>And all that I was</p>
        <p>I've left behind me</p>
        <br>
        <p>Eyes in the dead still water</p>
        <p>Tried but it pushed back harder</p>
        <p>Cauterized and atrophied</p>
        <p>This is my unbecoming</p>
        <p>Knives in the backs of martyrs</p>
        <p>Lives in the burning fodder</p>
        <p>Cauterized and atrophied</p>
        <p>This is my unbecoming</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now I wait</p>
        <p>This metamorphosis</p>
        <p>All that is left is the change</p>
        <p>Selfish fate</p>
        <p>I think you made me this</p>
        <p>Under the water I wait</p>
        <br>
        <p>Eyes in the dead still water</p>
        <p>Tried but it pushed back harder</p>
        <p>Cauterized and atrophied</p>
        <p>This is my unbecoming</p>
        <p>Knives in the backs of martyrs</p>
        <p>Lives in the burning fodder</p>
        <p>Cauterized and atrophied</p>
        <p>This is my unbecoming</p>
