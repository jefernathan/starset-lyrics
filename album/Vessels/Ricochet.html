        <h1>Ricochet</h1>
        <p>And we were bold</p>
        <p>Over the world</p>
        <p>We were flying through the satellites</p>
        <p>We had ahold</p>
        <p>Of the lightning strikes</p>
        <p>When we should have been afraid of heights</p>
        <p>And I was trying just to get you</p>
        <p>And now I'm dying to forget you</p>
        <p>Cause I knew I couldn't catch you</p>
        <p>So I left the sky</p>
        <p>And I fell behind</p>
        <br>
        <p>We were one in the same</p>
        <p>Running like moths to the flame</p>
        <p>You'd hang on every word I'd say</p>
        <p>But now they only ricochet</p>
        <p>We were falling away</p>
        <p>You left me with a bittersweet taste</p>
        <p>But when I send my heart your way</p>
        <p>It bounces off the walls you made</p>
        <p>Ricochet</p>
        <br>
        <p>If I was whole</p>
        <p>I'd turn right now</p>
        <p>I'd forget it and just walk away</p>
        <p>Cause I've been told</p>
        <p>That I'm dragging it out</p>
        <p>But I've been dying just to see your face</p>
        <p>And all I wanted was to say "goodbye"</p>
        <p>Into the fortress and you're stuck behind</p>
        <p>And in the silence now I realize</p>
        <p>That after all I built the wall</p>
        <br>
        <p>We were one in the same</p>
        <p>Running like moths to the flame</p>
        <p>You'd hang on every word I'd say</p>
        <p>But now they only ricochet</p>
        <p>You were falling away</p>
        <p>You left me with a bittersweet taste</p>
        <p>But when I send my heart your way</p>
        <p>It bounces off the walls you made</p>
        <p>Ricochet</p>
        <br>
        <p>All these broken souls</p>
        <p>They never make me whole</p>
        <p>They don't, they don't know my heart</p>
        <p>They don't know my heart</p>
        <br>
        <p>All these broken souls</p>
        <p>Each one more beautiful</p>
        <p>They don't, they don't know my heart</p>
        <p>They don't know my heart</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'll send out my soul</p>
        <p>To worlds more beautiful</p>
        <p>But they won't, they won't know my heart</p>
        <p>It's the darkest part</p>
        <br>
        <p>We were one in the same</p>
        <p>Running like moths to the flame</p>
        <p>You'd hang on every word I'd say</p>
        <p>But now they only ricochet</p>
        <p>You were falling away</p>
        <p>You left me with a bittersweet taste</p>
        <p>But when I send my heart your way</p>
        <p>It bounces off the walls you made</p>
        <p>Ricochet</p>
