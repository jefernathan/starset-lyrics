        <h1>Monster</h1>
        <p>Under the knife I surrendered</p>
        <p>The innocence yours to consume</p>
        <p>You cut it away</p>
        <p>And you filled me up with hate</p>
        <p>Into the silence you sent me</p>
        <p>Into the fire consumed</p>
        <p>You thought I'd forget</p>
        <p>But it's always in my head</p>
        <br>
        <p>You're the pulse in my veins</p>
        <p>You're the war that I wage</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>You're the love that I hate</p>
        <p>You're the drug that I take</p>
        <p>Will you cage me?</p>
        <p>Will you cage me?</p>
        <p>You're the pulse in my veins</p>
        <p>You're the war that I wage</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>From the monster you made me?</p>
        <p>From the monster you made me?</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is the world you've created</p>
        <p>The product of what I've become</p>
        <p>My soul and my youth</p>
        <p>Seems it's all for you to use</p>
        <p>If I could take back the moment</p>
        <p>I let you get under my skin</p>
        <p>Relent or resist?</p>
        <p>Seems the monster always wins</p>
        <br>
        <p>You're the pulse in my veins</p>
        <p>You're the war that I wage</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>You're the love that I hate</p>
        <p>You're the drug that I take</p>
        <p>Will you cage me?</p>
        <p>Will you cage me?</p>
        <p>You're the pulse in my veins</p>
        <p>You're the war that I wage</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>From the monster you made me?</p>
        <p>From the monster you made me?</p>
        <br>
        <p>My heart's an artifice, a decoy soul</p>
        <p>I'll lift you up and then I'll let you go</p>
        <p>I've made an art of digging shallow holes</p>
        <p>I drop the darkness in and watch it grow</p>
        <p>My heart's an artifice, a decoy soul</p>
        <p>Who knew the emptiness could be so cold?</p>
        <p>I've lost the parts of me that make me whole</p>
        <p>I am the darkness</p>
        <p>I'm the monster</p>
        <br>
        <p>You're the pulse in my veins</p>
        <p>You're the war that I wage</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>You're the love that I hate</p>
        <p>You're the drug that I take</p>
        <p>Will you cage me?</p>
        <p>Will you cage me?</p>
        <p>You're the pulse in my veins</p>
        <p>You're the war that I wage</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>Can you change me?</p>
        <p>From the monster you made me?</p>
        <p>The monster you made me?</p>
        <p>The monster you made me?</p>
        <p>The monster you made me?</p>
