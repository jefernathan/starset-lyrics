        <h1>Gravity Of You</h1>
        <p>There's a silencing</p>
        <p>As the machine arrives here</p>
        <p>I feel it pulling me</p>
        <p>I feel the past that's died there</p>
        <p>I hear it calling me</p>
        <p>"You can come alive here."</p>
        <p>I hear it beckoning</p>
        <p>Until I am inside</p>
        <br>
        <p>Riding the horizon</p>
        <p>Falling into you</p>
        <p>Feel the vessel tighten</p>
        <p>I feel you pull me through</p>
        <p>A new world is breaking</p>
        <p>Your heart is unveiling</p>
        <p>Breaking into pieces</p>
        <p>In the gravity of you</p>
        <p>In the gravity of you</p>
        <br>
        <p>I see the empty dreams</p>
        <p>Race across the sky here</p>
        <p>I see energy streams</p>
        <p>Where the ashes lie here</p>
        <p>I feel you here with me</p>
        <p>When all the hope has died here</p>
        <p>It's boring holes in me</p>
        <p>Enough to get inside</p>
        <br>
        <p>Riding the horizon</p>
        <p>Falling into you</p>
        <p>Feel the vessel tighten</p>
        <p>I feel you pull me through</p>
        <p>A new world is breaking</p>
        <p>Your heart is unveiling</p>
        <p>Breaking into pieces</p>
        <p>In the gravity of you</p>
        <p>In the gravity of you</p>
        <br>
        <p>To fall in the star is to be nothingness</p>
        <p>To escape is to be empty</p>
        <p>Fall into the star and then we won't exist</p>
        <p>Or escape into the nothing</p>
        <p>[x2]</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your sky</p>
        <p>The beauty alone is worth it</p>
        <p>I will risk it all to own it</p>
        <br>
        <p>Riding the horizon</p>
        <p>Falling into you</p>
        <p>Feel the vessel tighten</p>
        <p>I feel you pull me through</p>
        <p>A new world is breaking</p>
        <p>Your heart is unveiling</p>
        <p>Breaking into pieces</p>
        <p>In the gravity of you</p>
        <p>In the gravity of you</p>
