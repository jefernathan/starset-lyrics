        <h1>Starlight</h1>
        <p>Stardust</p>
        <p>In you and in me</p>
        <p>Fuse us</p>
        <p>Into unity</p>
        <p>Primeval</p>
        <p>We're coupled</p>
        <p>Born from the universe</p>
        <p>Farewell</p>
        <p>The void is calling</p>
        <p>Don't fear</p>
        <p>For futures and dreams</p>
        <p>They're fleeting, retreating</p>
        <p>It's ok</p>
        <p>I promise</p>
        <br>
        <p>I don't know what to say</p>
        <p>But I'm going to want you till the stars evaporate</p>
        <p>We're only here for just a moment in the light</p>
        <p>One day it shines for us the next we're in the night</p>
        <p>So say the word and I'll be running back to find you</p>
        <p>A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through</p>
        <p>I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight</p>
        <p>Of your starlight</p>
        <br>
        <p>Tell me</p>
        <p>Just tell me to stay</p>
        <p>I'll turn</p>
        <p>I won't look away</p>
        <p>I'll stay here</p>
        <p>I'll never go but you don't feel the same</p>
        <p>Farewell</p>
        <p>Farewell and godspeed</p>
        <p>Light years</p>
        <p>Between you and me</p>
        <p>I'm fading</p>
        <p>Your beauty conquers the darkness</p>
        <br>
        <p>At night the earth will rise</p>
        <p>And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies</p>
        <p>Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite</p>
        <p>I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light</p>
        <p>And I'll fall in love with you again</p>
        <p>I will find you</p>
        <p>A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through</p>
        <p>I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight of your starlight</p>
        <br>
        <p>Don't leave me lost here forever</p>
        <p>Show me your starlight and pull me through</p>
        <p>Don't leave me lost here forever</p>
        <p>I need your starlight and pull me through</p>
        <p>Bring me back to you</p>
        <br>
        <p>At night the earth will rise</p>
        <p>And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies</p>
        <p>Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite</p>
        <p>I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light</p>
        <p>And I'll fall in love with you again</p>
        <p>I will find you</p>
        <p>A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through</p>
        <p>I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight of your starlight</p>
