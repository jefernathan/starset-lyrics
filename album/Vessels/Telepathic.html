        <h1>Telepathic</h1>
        <p>And if I had my way</p>
        <p>I would run to the rescue</p>
        <p>It never works that way</p>
        <p>When you call a bluff</p>
        <br>
        <p>Oh, all the fools rush in</p>
        <p>It's a battle to surround you</p>
        <p>And all the fools want in</p>
        <p>But I'm not giving up</p>
        <br>
        <p>I don't wanna let you go</p>
        <p>But I can't stand to watch this</p>
        <p>I don't wanna let you know</p>
        <p>But you can read my mind</p>
        <br>
        <p>I feel it all the time</p>
        <p>Felt it all around you</p>
        <p>You had me under spell right from the start</p>
        <p>I don't have a telepathic heart</p>
        <p>Telepathic</p>
        <br>
        <p>Blind, I fall into the line</p>
        <p>That's waiting just to get you</p>
        <p>But I don't ever know just what we are</p>
        <p>I don't have a telepathic heart</p>
        <p>Telepathic</p>
        <br>
        <p>Look inside my brain</p>
        <p>You know what I want before I tell you</p>
        <p>Give me the words to say to make it enough</p>
        <p>Don't want your star-crossed fate</p>
        <p>You are the sun, I am the full moon</p>
        <p>Don't leave me lost in vain</p>
        <p>I can be what you want</p>
        <br>
        <p>I don't wanna let you go</p>
        <p>But I can't stand to watch this</p>
        <p>I don't wanna let you know</p>
        <p>But you can read my mind</p>
        <br>
        <p>I feel it all the time</p>
        <p>Felt it all around you</p>
        <p>You had me under spell right from the start</p>
        <p>I don't have a telepathic heart</p>
        <p>Telepathic</p>
        <br>
        <p>Blind, I fall into the line</p>
        <p>That's waiting just to get you</p>
        <p>But I don't ever know just what we are</p>
        <p>I don't have a telepathic heart</p>
        <p>Telepathic</p>
        <p>Telepathic</p>
        <p>Telepathic</p>
        <br>
        <p>And you always turn away</p>
        <p>Back to the start when I break through</p>
        <p>You can run, you can run away</p>
        <p>I will wait in the dark for you</p>
        <p>Should've never fell this way</p>
        <p>Cause you're the sun and I'm just a moon</p>
        <p>I'm in the dark 'till you light the way</p>
        <p>Cause I'm see through</p>
        <p>You can read my mind</p>
        <br>
        <p>I feel it all the time</p>
        <p>Felt it all around you</p>
        <p>You had me under spell right from the start</p>
        <p>I don't have a telepathic heart</p>
        <p>Telepathic</p>
        <br>
        <p>Blind, I fall into the line</p>
        <p>That's waiting just to get you</p>
        <p>But I don't ever know just what we are</p>
        <p>I don't have a telepathic heart</p>
        <p>Telepathic</p>
        <p>Telepathic</p>
        <p>Telepathic</p>
