        <h1>Die For You</h1>
        <p>I will run alone tonight</p>
        <p>Without you by my side</p>
        <p>I guess you had a place you had to get to</p>
        <p>I know your eyes</p>
        <p>I know inside</p>
        <p>The walls you hide behind</p>
        <p>And I saw the truth inside the real you</p>
        <p>Because I know you're lost when you run away</p>
        <p>Into the same black holes and black mistakes</p>
        <p>Taking all my will just to run alone</p>
        <p>When are you coming home?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even if the sky does fall</p>
        <p>Even if they take it all</p>
        <p>There's no pain that I won't go through</p>
        <p>Even if I have to die for you</p>
        <br>
        <p>And when all the fires burn</p>
        <p>When everything is overturning</p>
        <p>There's no thing that I won't go through</p>
        <p>Even if I have to die for you</p>
        <br>
        <p>One day the earth will open wide</p>
        <p>And I'll follow you inside</p>
        <p>Cause the only hell I know is without you</p>
        <p>Some day when galaxies collide</p>
        <p>We'll be lost on different skies</p>
        <p>I will send my rocket ship to find you</p>
        <p>Because I know you're lost when you run away</p>
        <p>Into the same black holes and black mistakes</p>
        <p>Taking all my will just to run alone</p>
        <p>Until I bring you home</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even if the sky does fall</p>
        <p>Even if they take it all</p>
        <p>There's no pain that I won't go through</p>
        <p>Even if I have to die for you</p>
        <br>
        <p>And when all the fires burn</p>
        <p>When everything is overturning</p>
        <p>There's no thing that I won't go through</p>
        <p>Even if I have to die for you</p>
        <br>
        <p>And if the sun grows cold for you along the way</p>
        <p>And if the stars don't line to light the way</p>
        <p>And when you fall away and crash back down below</p>
        <p>I'll search the skies for you and I'll follow</p>
        <p>I'll be in your afterglow</p>
        <p>And I'll bring you home</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even if the sky does fall</p>
        <p>Even if they take it all</p>
        <p>I can't see but I'll follow you</p>
        <p>Even if I'd die...</p>
        <br>
        <p>And when all the fires burn</p>
        <p>When everything is overturning</p>
        <p>There's no thing that I won't go through</p>
        <p>Even if I have to die for you</p>
