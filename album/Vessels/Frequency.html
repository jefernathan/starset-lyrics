        <h1>Frequency</h1>
        <p>I was scanning through the skies</p>
        <p>And missed the static in your eyes</p>
        <p>Something blocking your reception</p>
        <p>It's distorting our connection</p>
        <p>With the distance amplified</p>
        <p>Was it all just synthesized?</p>
        <p>And now the silence screams that you are gone</p>
        <p>You've tuned me out</p>
        <p>I've lost your frequency</p>
        <p>There's something here that's broken</p>
        <p>There's something here with no end</p>
        <p>It's paralyzed</p>
        <p>It's in your eyes</p>
        <p>Cause I can feel your soul fade</p>
        <p>I can feel your heart change</p>
        <p>It falls out of phase with mine</p>
        <p>While you oscillate inside</p>
        <p>Or is it only in my head?</p>
        <p>I was scanning through the skies</p>
        <p>And missed the static in your eyes</p>
        <p>Something blocking your reception</p>
        <p>It's distorting our connection</p>
        <p>With the distance amplified</p>
        <p>Was it all just synthesized?</p>
        <p>And now the silence screams that you are gone</p>
        <p>You've tuned me out</p>
        <p>I've lost your frequency</p>
        <p>Left inside a half-life</p>
        <p>Irradiated insides</p>
        <p>These memories</p>
        <p>They never leave</p>
        <p>I bared my soul for you and all I got was static</p>
        <p>My heart was bulletproof till you took off the jacket</p>
        <p>I was scanning through the skies</p>
        <p>And missed the static in your eyes</p>
        <p>Something blocking your reception</p>
        <p>It's distorting our connection</p>
        <p>With the distance amplified</p>
        <p>Was it all just synthesized?</p>
        <p>And now the silence screams that you are gone</p>
        <p>You've tuned me out</p>
        <p>I've lost your frequency</p>
        <p>Lost your frequency</p>
        <p>Castaway</p>
        <p>My cries are blocked by the horizon</p>
        <p>Suffocate</p>
        <p>I was doing this all for you</p>
        <p>I'm in the shallows</p>
        <p>Stuck in the gallows</p>
        <p>I tried to save you now I'm swallowed</p>
        <p>You wanted war</p>
        <p>I am the war</p>
        <p>I alone</p>
        <p>Something blocking your reception</p>
        <p>It's distorting our connection</p>
        <p>With the distance amplified</p>
        <p>Was it all just synthesized?</p>
        <p>And now the silence screams that you are gone</p>
        <p>You've tuned me out</p>
        <p>I've lost your frequency</p>
