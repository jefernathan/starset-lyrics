        <h1>Halo</h1>
        <p>I can see you running, running</p>
        <p>Every night from the same darkness</p>
        <p>It's coming, coming
        <p>But you are not alone</p>
        <p>If you just say the word</p>
        <p>I'll be there by your side</p>
        <p>You make me more</p>
        <p>You make me superhuman</p>
        <p>And if you need me to</p>
        <p>I will save you</p>
        <br>
        <p>Send out the signal and I'll fly low</p>
        <p>If it means the death of me, I won't let go</p>
        <p>And if I'm lost in the world's shadows</p>
        <p>I'll use the light that comes to me</p>
        <p>From your halo</p>
        <p>Your halo</p>
        <p>Halo</p>
        <br>
        <p>When you're backed against the wall</p>
        <p>I could be the one who's always there to break your fall</p>
        <p>You are not alone</p>
        <p>You're the sun, you're the day</p>
        <p>The light that guides me through</p>
        <p>Never run, run away</p>
        <p>I will save you</p>
        <br>
        <p>Send out the signal and I'll fly low</p>
        <p>If it means the death of me</p>
        <p>I won't let go</p>
        <p>And if I'm lost in the world's shadows</p>
        <p>I'll use the light that comes to me</p>
        <p>From your halo</p>
        <br>
        <p>Send out the signal and I'll fly low</p>
        <p>If it means the death of me</p>
        <p>I won't let go</p>
        <p>And if I'm lost in the world's shadows</p>
        <p>I'll use the light that comes to me</p>
        <p>From your halo</p>
        <br>
        <p>And if I'm lost in the world's shadows</p>
        <p>I'll use the light that comes to me</p>
        <p>From your halo</p>
        <p>Your halo</p>
        <p>Your halo</p>
        <br>
        <p>I won't let go</p>
        <p>I won't let go</p>
        <p>I won't let go</p>
        <p>I won't let go</p>
        <p>I won't let go</p>
        <br>
        <p>And if I'm lost in the world's shadows</p>
        <p>I'll use the light that comes to me</p>
        <p>From your halo</p>
        <p>Your halo</p>
