        <h1>It Has Begun</h1>
        <p>Even a well-lit place can hide salvation</p>
        <p>A map to a one-man maze that never sees the sun</p>
        <p>Where the lost are the heroes</p>
        <p>And the thieves are left to drown</p>
        <p>But everyone knows by now</p>
        <p>Fairy tales are not found</p>
        <p>They're written in the walls</p>
        <br>
        <p>As we walk in a straight line</p>
        <p>Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching</p>
        <p>But nothing could ever stop us</p>
        <p>From stealing our own place in the sun</p>
        <p>We will face the odds against us</p>
        <p>And run into the fear we run from</p>
        <br>
        <p>It has begun</p>
        <br>
        <p>Into the dark below</p>
        <p>Evading shadows</p>
        <p>Blind in a rabbit's hole</p>
        <p>We fall beneath the earth</p>
        <p>And watch the shell come unraveled</p>
        <p>As the seed begins to rise</p>
        <p>Embracing its starlit fate as we wait in the night</p>
        <p>It's written in the walls</p>
        <br>
        <p>As we walk in a straight line</p>
        <p>Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching</p>
        <p>But nothing could ever stop us</p>
        <p>From stealing our own place in the sun</p>
        <p>We will face the odds against us</p>
        <p>And run into the fear we run from</p>
        <br>
        <p>It has begun [5x]</p>
