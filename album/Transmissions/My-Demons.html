        <h1>My Demons</h1>
        <p>Mayday! Mayday!</p>
        <p>The ship is slowly sinking</p>
        <p>They think I'm crazy but they don't know the feeling</p>
        <p>They're all around me,</p>
        <p>Circling like vultures</p>
        <p>They wanna break me and wash away my colors</p>
        <p>Wash away my colors</p>
        <br>
        <p>Take me high and I'll sing</p>
        <p>Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay</p>
        <p>'Kay, Okay, Okay</p>
        <p>We are one in the same</p>
        <p>Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away</p>
        <p>'Way, away, away</p>
        <p>Save me if I become</p>
        <p>My demons</p>
        <br>
        <p>I cannot stop this sickness taking over</p>
        <p>It takes control and drags me into nowhere</p>
        <p>I need your help, I can't fight this forever</p>
        <p>I know you're watching,</p>
        <p>I can feel you out there</p>
        <br>
        <p>Take me high and I'll sing</p>
        <p>Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay</p>
        <p>'Kay, Okay, Okay</p>
        <p>We are one in the same</p>
        <p>Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away</p>
        <p>'Way, away, away</p>
        <p>Save me if I become</p>
        <p>My demons</p>
        <br>
        <p>Take me over the walls below</p>
        <p>Fly forever</p>
        <p>Don't let me go</p>
        <p>I need a savior to heal my pain</p>
        <p>When I become my worst enemy</p>
        <p>The enemy</p>
        <br>
        <p>Take me high and I'll sing</p>
        <p>Oh you make everything okay</p>
        <p>We are one in the same</p>
        <p>Oh you take all of the pain away</p>
        <br>
        <p>Take me high and I'll sing</p>
        <p>Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay</p>
        <p>'Kay, Okay, Okay</p>
        <p>We are one in the same</p>
        <p>Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away</p>
        <p>'Way, away, away</p>
        <p>Save me if I become</p>
        <p>My demons</p>
        <br>
        <p>Take me high and I'll sing</p>
        <p>Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay</p>
        <p>'Kay, Okay, Okay</p>
