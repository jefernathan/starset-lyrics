        <h1>Dark On Me</h1>
        <p>There's no hate,</p>
        <p>There's no love</p>
        <p>Only dark skies that hang above</p>
        <p>I call your name as I walk alone</p>
        <p>Send a signal to guide me home</p>
        <br>
        <p>Light the night up, you're my dark star</p>
        <p>And now you're falling away</p>
        <br>
        <p>But I found in you what was lost in me</p>
        <p>In a world so cold and empty</p>
        <p>I could lie awake just to watch you breathe</p>
        <p>In the dead of night, you went dark on me</p>
        <br>
        <p>You're the cause,</p>
        <p>The antidote</p>
        <p>The sinking ship that I could not let go</p>
        <p>You led my way then disappeared</p>
        <p>How could you just walk away and leave me here?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Light the night up, you're my dark star</p>
        <p>And now you're falling away</p>
        <br>
        <p>But I found in you what was lost in me</p>
        <p>In a world so cold and empty</p>
        <p>I could lie awake just to watch you breathe</p>
        <p>In the dead of night, you went dark on me</p>
        <br>
        <p>Blinded, I can't do this on my own</p>
        <p>You were all I've got, to guide me home</p>
        <br>
        <p>I could lie awake just to watch you breathe</p>
        <p>In the dead of night, you went dark on me</p>
        <br>
        <p>Dark on me, dark on me</p>
        <p>Dark on me, dark on me</p>
        <p>Dark on me</p>
        <br>
        <p>I could lie awake just to watch you breathe</p>
        <p>In the dead of night, you went dark on me</p>
