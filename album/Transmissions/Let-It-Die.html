        <h1>Let It Die</h1>
        <p>I cut you into pieces</p>
        <p>Searching for your imperfections</p>
        <p>I had plans to make you whole</p>
        <p>But all my threads couldn't stop the bleeding</p>
        <p>There's nothing left, but I'm not leaving</p>
        <p>When all I know is you</p>
        <br>
        <p>I've been looking for a way</p>
        <p>To bring you back to life</p>
        <p>And if I could find a way,</p>
        <p>Then I would bring you back tonight</p>
        <p>I'd make you look, I'd make you lie</p>
        <p>I'd take the coldness from your eyes</p>
        <p>But you told me, if you love me</p>
        <p>Let it die</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your eyes stare right through me</p>
        <p>Ignoring my failed attempts to</p>
        <p>Breathe back life into your veins</p>
        <p>But I can't start your cold heart beating</p>
        <p>You're so far gone, but I'm not leaving</p>
        <p>When all I know is you</p>
        <br>
        <p>I've been looking for a way</p>
        <p>To bring you back to life</p>
        <p>And if I could find a way,</p>
        <p>Then I would bring you back tonight</p>
        <p>I'd make you look, I'd make you lie</p>
        <p>I'd take the coldness from your eyes</p>
        <p>But you told me, if you love me</p>
        <p>Let it die</p>
        <br>
        <p>And you left me more dead</p>
        <p>Than you'll ever know</p>
        <p>When you left me alone</p>
        <br>
        <p>I've been looking for a way</p>
        <p>To bring you back to life</p>
        <p>And if I could find a way,</p>
        <p>Then I would bring you back tonight</p>
        <p>I'd make you look, I'd make you lie</p>
        <p>I'd take the coldness from your eyes</p>
        <p>But you told me, if you love me</p>
        <p>Let it die</p>
        <br>
        <p>Let it die [3x]</p>
