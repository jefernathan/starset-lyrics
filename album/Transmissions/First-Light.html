        <p>Cascading waves of change</p>
        <p>The future</p>
        <p>Events we think to be inconsequential,</p>
        <p>Can affect the future unintentionally</p>
        <br>
        <p>What if you had the power to affect monumental change.</p>
        <p>Would you let fear consume or would you overcome?</p>
        <br>
        <p>We sent a message into the past, a warning</p>
        <p>We have that message</p>
        <p>Though this story is not inevitable,</p>
        <p>And a society does evolve.</p>
        <p>We can change our fate,</p>
        <p>We can change the future,</p>
        <p>We can change the past.</p>
