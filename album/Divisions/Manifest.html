        <h1>Manifest</h1>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>This love is in retrograde</p>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>I can see the darkness</p>
        <p>Manifest</p>
        <br>
        <p>Gravity</p>
        <p>I pull on you</p>
        <p>Close enough to rendezvous</p>
        <p>You come to me and then you slip right through</p>
        <p>I'm in the solitude</p>
        <p>Why's it always touch and go?</p>
        <p>Now we'll never even know what it's like</p>
        <p>Left me in the afterglow</p>
        <p>Till I'm falling through space and time</p>
        <br>
        <p>Starlight, star bright</p>
        <p>You got your missiles flying through the air tonight</p>
        <p>And it's alright, alright</p>
        <p>I think I'm getting used to the firefight</p>
        <br>
        <p>'Cause you fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>This love is in retrograde</p>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>I kinda think you like this</p>
        <p>Regress</p>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>There's something in the hate we make</p>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>I can see the darkness</p>
        <p>Manifest</p>
        <br>
        <p>Every time I'm on to you</p>
        <p>You change it up, you always do</p>
        <p>So tell me why you gotta bring your guns?</p>
        <p>It's Armageddon</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is always touch and go?</p>
        <p>Now we'll never even know what it's like</p>
        <p>Left me with no place to go</p>
        <p>Now I'm falling through space and time</p>
        <p>(Time)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Starlight, star bright</p>
        <p>Every night you're dimmer, have you finally fell?</p>
        <p>You said it's alright, alright</p>
        <p>But I've been getting ready for the bombshell</p>
        <br>
        <p>'Cause you fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>This love is in retrograde</p>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>I kinda think you like this</p>
        <p>Regress</p>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>There's something in the hate we make</p>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>I can see the darkness</p>
        <br>
        <p>Is my fate silver-lined?</p>
        <p>I always was the optimist</p>
        <p>But I never thought of this</p>
        <p>Stuck in this state, misaligned</p>
        <p>Trapped inside the looking glass</p>
        <p>Tell me when will all this pass</p>
        <p>Oh, how I hate the silver line</p>
        <p>Never could taste your life</p>
        <p>Never my place and time</p>
        <p>I'm here, left behind</p>
        <p>Never your state of mind</p>
        <p>Never in phase with mine</p>
        <br>
        <p>'Cause you fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>This love is in retrograde</p>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>I kinda think you like this</p>
        <p>Regress</p>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>There's something in the hate we make</p>
        <p>Fall in and fall away</p>
        <p>I can see the darkness</p>
        <p>Manifest</p>
