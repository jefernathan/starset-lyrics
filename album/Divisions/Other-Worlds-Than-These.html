        <h1>Other Worlds Than These</h1>
        <p>Ten feet tall behind your wall</p>
        <p>Telling yourself that you're not small</p>
        <p>Roll yourself into a tight ball</p>
        <p>You can't be lost, if you've gone AWOL</p>
        <br>
        <p>You've never had one question</p>
        <p>So comfortable living life so certain</p>
        <p>Let me tell you about this then</p>
        <p>No one really knows the truth</p>
        <p>No, not you</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are monsters in the sky</p>
        <p>There are demons in the sea</p>
        <p>I have seen them with my eyes</p>
        <p>I've seen what you won't see</p>
        <p>Pull the wool out from your eyes</p>
        <p>It won't shade your frail belief</p>
        <p>In the end we cannot hide</p>
        <p>There are other worlds than these</p>
        <br>
        <p>Closed up minds are hearty seeds</p>
        <p>So plant yourself a gallows tree</p>
        <p>Bury your head so you won't see</p>
        <p>The truth you hide is the truth you seek</p>
        <p>Feed it fiction and lies</p>
        <p>Oh, how it grows, the roots are all shallow</p>
        <p>Hide yourself up inside</p>
        <p>And on it goes</p>
        <p>Reaping from the cell you sow</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are monsters in the sky</p>
        <p>There are demons in the sea</p>
        <p>I have seen them with my eyes</p>
        <p>I've seen what you won't see</p>
        <p>Pull the wool out from your eyes</p>
        <p>It won't shade your frail belief</p>
        <p>In the end we cannot hide</p>
        <p>There are other worlds than these</p>
        <br>
        <p>Is it all an oddity?</p>
        <p>Are we flakes of empty dust</p>
        <p>Spinning on a ball of rust? Maybe</p>
        <p>But the light is ours to see</p>
        <p>You had eyes but sewed them shut</p>
        <p>But the feeling in your gut won't fade</p>
        <p>Is it all a tragedy?</p>
        <p>Are we flashes in a rut</p>
        <p>Going in and out of luck? Maybe</p>
        <p>But the answers will not change</p>
        <p>Even when they're covered up</p>
        <p>All these questions in your gut</p>
        <p>Won't fade</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are monsters in the sky</p>
        <p>There are demons in the sea</p>
        <p>I have seen them with my eyes</p>
        <p>I've seen what you won't see</p>
        <p>Pull the wool out from your eyes</p>
        <p>It won't shade your frail belief</p>
        <p>In the end we cannot hide</p>
        <p>There are other worlds than</p>
        <p>Worlds than these</p>
