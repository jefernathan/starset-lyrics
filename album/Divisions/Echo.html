        <h1>Echo</h1>
        <p>I used to be divinity</p>
        <p>I used to be a god in my mind</p>
        <p>Sailing in an Odyssey</p>
        <p>I didn't know I was blind</p>
        <p>And when every time I set a course into the dark night</p>
        <p>You would follow me silently with searchlights</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was only in my mind</p>
        <p>You were on the outside waiting</p>
        <p>I could feel you all the time</p>
        <p>Your voice could save me</p>
        <p>Now all these Sirens sing for me</p>
        <p>But I just wanna hear your melody</p>
        <p>I call and I can hear you sing</p>
        <p>But oh</p>
        <p>It's only my echo</p>
        <p>It's only my echo</p>
        <br>
        <p>I thought it was destiny</p>
        <p>I was gonna conquer the sky</p>
        <p>Then plummet to the ground and be</p>
        <p>Anchored by your side</p>
        <p>But when every time I found myself upon new heights</p>
        <p>I would climb again and</p>
        <p>Leave you in</p>
        <p>The moonlight</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was only in my mind</p>
        <p>You were on the outside waiting</p>
        <p>I could feel you all the time</p>
        <p>Your voice could save me</p>
        <p>Now all these Sirens sing for me</p>
        <p>But I just wanna hear your melody</p>
        <p>I call and I can hear you sing</p>
        <p>But oh</p>
        <p>It's only my echo</p>
        <p>It's only my echo</p>
        <br>
        <p>I know life is a journey</p>
        <p>So what happened to me?</p>
        <p>Tell me—why was I in such a hurry?</p>
        <p>I don't know, I don't know</p>
        <br>
        <p>I know life is a journey</p>
        <p>But you gave up on me early</p>
        <p>Tell me—why were you in such a hurry?</p>
        <p>I don't know, I don't know</p>
        <br>
        <p>Show the way cause it's blurry</p>
        <p>Show the way and your mercy to me</p>
        <p>Nothing there and I'm worried</p>
        <p>It's all I know, all I know</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was only in my mind</p>
        <p>You were on the outside waiting</p>
        <p>I could feel you all the time</p>
        <p>Your voice could save me</p>
        <p>Now all these Sirens sing for me</p>
        <p>But I just wanna hear your melody</p>
        <p>I call and I can hear you sing</p>
        <p>But oh</p>
        <p>It's only my echo</p>
        <p>It's only my echo</p>
