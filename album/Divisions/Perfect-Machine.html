        <h1>Perfect Machine</h1>
        <p>Show me your insides</p>
        <p>Show me your secrets</p>
        <p>Show me what you desire</p>
        <p>I can fake it</p>
        <p>Show what you wanted</p>
        <p>So I can be it</p>
        <p>And if I bend just right</p>
        <p>I can make it</p>
        <br>
        <p>I didn't want you</p>
        <p>I wanna watch you change</p>
        <p>From a butterfly and into chains</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lay your heart into my perfect machine</p>
        <p>I will show you what you wanted to see</p>
        <p>Just a mirror till I get what I need</p>
        <p>The reverie was not of me</p>
        <p>You never saw nothing</p>
        <p>Never saw nothing</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm just a liar without deceiving</p>
        <p>I'm just a broken clown</p>
        <p>Make believing</p>
        <p>I should've let you know you should've ran for cover</p>
        <p>I'm just a parlor trick, a two-bit counterfeit</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lay your heart into my perfect machine</p>
        <p>I will use it to protect you from me</p>
        <p>I will never let you see what's beneath</p>
        <p>So good for you and good for me</p>
        <p>We told ourselves we're</p>
        <p>Right where we ought to be</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even you know, even you know</p>
        <p>This was all for nothing</p>
        <p>Just a sad show, just an ego</p>
        <p>I suppose though, as far as I know</p>
        <p>We were both pretending</p>
        <p>I suppose so, but what do I know?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even you know, even you know</p>
        <p>This was all for nothing</p>
        <p>Just a sad show, just an ego</p>
        <p>I suppose though, as far as I know</p>
        <p>We were both pretending</p>
        <p>I suppose so, but what do I know?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lay your heart into my perfect machine</p>
        <p>I will show you what you wanted to see</p>
        <p>Just a mirror till I get what I need</p>
        <p>The reverie was not of me</p>
        <p>You never saw nothing</p>
        <p>Never saw nothing</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lay your heart into my perfect machine</p>
        <p>I will use it to protect you from me</p>
        <p>I will never let you see what's beneath</p>
        <p>So good for you and good for me</p>
