        <h1>Trials</h1>
        <p>These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are</p>
        <p>We're motivated by the scars that we're made of</p>
        <p>These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are</p>
        <p>We take our places in the dark</p>
        <p>And turn our hearts to the stars</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hear me from the bottom</p>
        <p>Forged in regret, I'm the silversmith</p>
        <p>Doomsday</p>
        <p>You had it coming</p>
        <p>Marching the streets with an iron fist</p>
        <p>Obey no more in silence</p>
        <p>The steel in our hearts will be monuments</p>
        <p>Today</p>
        <p>They'll hear the violence</p>
        <p>We'll rise from the dark like Lazarus</p>
        <br>
        <p>These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are</p>
        <p>We're motivated by the scars that we're made of</p>
        <p>These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are</p>
        <p>We take our places in the dark</p>
        <p>And turn our hearts to the stars</p>
        <br>
        <p>The ending won't be forgotten</p>
        <p>It's written in the stars and the hieroglyphs</p>
        <p>Sending the lion-hearted</p>
        <p>The stones break bones</p>
        <p>But we're venomous</p>
        <br>
        <p>These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are</p>
        <p>We're motivated by the scars that we're made of</p>
        <p>These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are</p>
        <p>We take our places in the dark</p>
        <p>And turn our hearts to the stars</p>
        <br>
        <p>Calling, calling</p>
        <p>We've come out to play</p>
        <p>Show me, show me</p>
        <p>A new way</p>
        <p>Slowly, slowly</p>
        <p>They've led you astray</p>
        <p>Away we go now</p>
        <p>Into the fray</p>
        <br>
        <p>These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are</p>
        <p>We're motivated by the scars that we're made of</p>
        <p>These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are</p>
        <p>We take our places in the dark</p>
        <p>And turn our hearts to the stars</p>
