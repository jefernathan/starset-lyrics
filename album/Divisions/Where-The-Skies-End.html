        <h1>Where The Skies End</h1>
        <p>In a restless search for new opportunities and new ways of living, the mystery and the promise of distant horizons always have called men forward.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We are the lost and the silent</p>
        <p>We are the shackled and small</p>
        <p>We're looking up at the giants</p>
        <p>We're going to watch when they fall</p>
        <br>
        <p>Do you hear me?</p>
        <p>You're a Goliath to me</p>
        <p>I'll be there when the bombs unfurl</p>
        <p>Till the war is over</p>
        <p>Lay your burdens on me</p>
        <p>I can bear all the weight of the world</p>
        <p>With you on my shoulders</p>
        <br>
        <p>We won't just fall away</p>
        <p>We weren't just born to fade</p>
        <p>Our stories are past the horizon</p>
        <p>We're chasing the sun till we find them</p>
        <p>Goodbye to what we made</p>
        <p>No matter anyway</p>
        <p>We're climbing until we transcend</p>
        <p>Higher, higher to where the skies end</p>
        <br>
        <p>These are the dreams of our fathers</p>
        <p>There'll be no wishing on the stars</p>
        <p>We are the sons and the daughters</p>
        <p>Let them come test who we are</p>
        <br>
        <p>Can you hear me?</p>
        <p>You're a Goliath to me</p>
        <p>I'll be there when the guns break out</p>
        <p>Till the storm is over</p>
        <p>Lay your burdens on me</p>
        <p>I'll be there when your fate runs out</p>
        <p>You'll be on my shoulders</p>
        <br>
        <p>We won't just fall away</p>
        <p>We weren't just born to fade</p>
        <p>Our stories are past the horizon</p>
        <p>We're chasing the sun till we find them</p>
        <p>Goodbye to what we made</p>
        <p>No matter anyway</p>
        <p>We're climbing until we transcend</p>
        <p>Higher, higher to where the skies end</p>
        <br>
        <p>We left our chains</p>
        <p>We left them below</p>
        <p>We are all rising above</p>
        <p>We were not born to stay low</p>
        <br>
        <p>Show me your strength</p>
        <p>It's more than you know</p>
        <p>You'll never know what you're made of</p>
        <p>Until you set foot down the road</p>
        <p>We knew this day</p>
        <p>Was set long ago</p>
        <p>And when the sharks smell the blood</p>
        <p>They will all see it's their own</p>
        <p>Own, own, own, own</p>
        <br>
        <p>We won't just fall away</p>
        <p>We weren't just born to fade</p>
        <p>Our stories are past the horizon</p>
        <p>We're chasing the sun till we find them</p>
        <p>Goodbye to what we made</p>
        <p>No matter anyway</p>
        <p>We're climbing until we transcend</p>
        <p>Higher, higher to where the skies end</p>
        <br>
        <p>In a search that has continued for centuries, some far-out distant view with its promise of the unseen, and its promise of the unknown, has forever fathered the impulse to seek for new things in new places, new horizons.</p>
