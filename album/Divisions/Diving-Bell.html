        <h1>Diving Bell</h1>
        <p>Prepare the diving bell</p>
        <p>It's time to take this low again</p>
        <p>I sink into myself, low</p>
        <p>No need for farewell</p>
        <p>I know you always understand</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sorry there's no place for you inside the solitude</p>
        <p>Just stay up here until I'm back again</p>
        <p>I swear I'll be there for you</p>
        <p>I swear I'll follow through</p>
        <p>Stay the course and keep the ship manned</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was certain if I fell through the bottom</p>
        <p>You'd be happy just to float here on your own</p>
        <p>I was never quite prepared for the long ride, oh</p>
        <p>Away, away, away, alone</p>
        <br>
        <p>Oh, this wasn't in my plans</p>
        <p>Abandoned ship and headed for the sand</p>
        <p>Oh, the albatross crash-lands</p>
        <p>I've got the sinking feeling that I never can go home</p>
        <br>
        <p>If I stare into the abyss</p>
        <p>Will it stare into me?</p>
        <p>If I stare into the abyss</p>
        <p>Will it stare into me?</p>
        <p>If I stare into the abyss</p>
        <p>Will it stare into me?</p>
        <p>If I stare into the abyss</p>
        <p>Will it stare into me?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Prepare the diving bell</p>
        <p>Maybe just for a spell, again</p>
        <p>As far as I can tell</p>
        <p>Oh, you knew me too well</p>
        <p>I miss you there when I descend</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sorry, there's no place for you inside the solitude</p>
        <p>Just stay up here until I'm back again</p>
        <br>
        <p>Oh, this wasn't in my plans</p>
        <p>Abandoned ship and headed for the sand</p>
        <p>Oh, the albatross crash-lands</p>
        <p>I've got the sinking feeling that I never can go home</p>
        <br>
        <p>If I stare into the abyss</p>
        <p>Will it stare into me?</p>
        <p>If I stare into the abyss</p>
        <p>Will it stare into me?</p>
        <p>If I stare into the abyss</p>
        <p>Will it stare into me?</p>
        <p>If I stare into the abyss</p>
        <p>Will it stare into me?</p>
        <br>
        <p>In my mind, endless sea</p>
        <p>Calling from the bottom, but you don't hear me</p>
        <p>Send your line down to me</p>
        <p>Meet me on the surface</p>
        <p>I will never leave</p>
        <br>
        <p>In my mind, endless sea</p>
        <p>Calling from the bottom but you don't hear me</p>
        <p>Send your line down to me</p>
        <p>Meet me on the surface</p>
        <p>I will never leave</p>
        <br>
        <p>Just one time, all I need</p>
        <p>Calling from the bottom but you don't hear me</p>
        <p>Stuck in time, stuck in me</p>
        <p>Broken on the bottom like a refugee</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wake me when the new day comes</p>
        <p>Together we will ride the sun</p>
        <p>The future is an empty gun</p>
        <p>We ride on to them one-by-one</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wake me when the new day comes</p>
