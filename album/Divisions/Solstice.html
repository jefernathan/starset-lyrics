        <h1>Solstice</h1>
        <p>I remember blue skies</p>
        <p>I remember how you were</p>
        <p>Sitting under star-shine, ever-bright</p>
        <p>Not ready but you were</p>
        <p>Pulled me in till I came alive</p>
        <p>To the sun, there was nothing higher</p>
        <p>In the solstice of your ever-light</p>
        <p>I saw to my future</p>
        <br>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the dark take over</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the dark take over</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was in a landslide</p>
        <p>You were an earthmover</p>
        <p>Trapped inside the confines of a mind</p>
        <p>My own paratrooper</p>
        <p>You dropped in till you stupefied</p>
        <p>Lit the sun, lit the black on fire</p>
        <p>You were solstice, you were ever-light</p>
        <p>And I miss the way you were</p>
        <br>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the dark take over</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the dark take over</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the dark take over</p>
        <br>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <p>You take, take the pain away</p>
        <br>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the dark take over</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the</p>
        <p>Don't let me let the dark take take</p>
        <p>Over</p>
        <p>Then it's over</p>
        <p>I get the feeling that it won't subside</p>
        <p>Then it's over, then it's over</p>
        <p>I get the feeling that it won't subside, then it goes</p>
